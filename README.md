# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned error handling with try and catch, deepened regular expression understanding .

**Thoughts:** Error handling was pretty new to me before today, I can see some interesting use cases for it. I've used regular expressions for a while now but today's work has definitely deepened my understanding of metacharacter symbols, shorthand character classes, brackets, braces, parentheses and assertions.

### Day 1: September 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Practiced object oriented programming through making a simple quiz app.

**Thoughts:** OOP is such an elegant way of structuring programs. I am willing to implement more OOP in the next future.

### Day 2: September 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned about iterators and generators in Javascript and I built a simple dating app using these concepts.

**Thoughts:** I had never come across iterators and generators before, I can definitely see a lot of use cases for them.

### Day 3: September 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I didn't learn anything new but I instead worked on a really fun challenge from frontendmentor.io.

**Thoughts:** I find building projects from scratch really rewarding!

### Day 4: September 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed a small project using async/ await and scroll event listener.

**Thoughts:** It's cool to be able to build a page that loads content infinitely.
