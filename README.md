# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned error handling with try and catch, deepened regular expression understanding .

**Thoughts:** Error handling was pretty new to me before today, I can see some interesting use cases for it. I've used regular expressions for a while now but today's work has definitely deepened my understanding of metacharacter symbols, shorthand character classes, brackets, braces, parentheses and assertions.

### Day 1: September 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Practiced object oriented programming through making a simple quiz app.

**Thoughts:** OOP is such an elegant way of structuring programs. I am willing to implement more OOP in the next future.

### Day 2: September 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned about iterators and generators in Javascript and I built a simple dating app using these concepts.

**Thoughts:** I had never come across iterators and generators before, I can definitely see a lot of use cases for them.

### Day 3: September 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I didn't learn anything new but I instead worked on a really fun challenge from frontendmentor.io.

**Thoughts:** I find building projects from scratch really rewarding!

### Day 4: September 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed a small project using async/ await and scroll event listener.

**Thoughts:** It's cool to be able to build a page that loads content infinitely.

### Day 5: September 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed one of the most advanced project I have ever worked on, an IP address tracker. I fetched the IP address locations from 'IP Geolocation API by IPify' and generated the map using 'LeafletJS'. 

**Thoughts:** I got a bit frustrated because the app could be definetely more mobile friendly and also my CSS is pretty messy. But my main focus at the moment is improving JS, so that's fine for now!

### Day 6: September 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I built this quote generator app HTML, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript. It was quite an easy project but I find re-iterating a fundamental step to really fully understand concepts. 

**Thoughts:** Repetition is key.

### Day 7: September 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Spent a few hours deepening my understanding of ES6 destructuring.

**Thoughts:** I am getting ready to learn React. Before moving onto that, I decided to spend a few days reviewing: destructuring, classes, high order array methods, fetch API & Promises.

### Day 8: September 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Spent a few hours deepening my understanding of ES5 Constructor functions & prototypes inheritance, ES6 Classes & Sub Classes.

**Thoughts:** I have reviewed these topics a lot lately and therefore they're getting more familiar.

### Day 9: September 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed High Order Array Methods.

**Thoughts:** I feel extremely confident using and manipulating arrays. Todays refresher was helpful though.

### Day 10: September 20, 2020
