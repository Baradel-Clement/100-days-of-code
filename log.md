# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned error handling with try and catch, deepened regular expression understanding .

**Thoughts:** Error handling was pretty new to me before today, I can see some interesting use cases for it. I've used regular expressions for a while now but today's work has definitely deepened my understanding of metacharacter symbols, shorthand character classes, brackets, braces, parentheses and assertions.
